Purpose of this tool
====================
This tool is an attempt to provide snippet like functionality, as seen in
many programming IDEs, on the command line. The code should be generic enough to
run bash like functions and extensible enough to be used for specific command
lines. This tool uses the python interface to the curses library to provide
functionality.

Design
====================
This tool will read from a file that will contain a snippet something like:

for (<template>; <template>; <template>) {
	<template>
}

The user will then be able to replace all sections of the snippet that are
marked by < and >. Only the sections marked will be editable. Navigating with
this restriction will be done using a special character, I've suggested the TAB
character. Navigation should wrap round once it reaches the end of the string.

The section that is currently being edited should be highlighted in
some manner. On 256 colour enabled terminals this could be a different colour,
grey background white text maybe. On simpler terminals maybe underlining or
italics.

Once all the template sections have been completed pressing the enter key will
complete the snippet and run it.

Tasks
===================
1) Read a snippet from file: Done
2) Highlight current edit position: Done
3) Add navigation using special character: Not started
4) Allow editing of snippets: Not started
5) Execute code on enter key: Not started

Possible extensions
===================
Allow validation of the snippet (a line by line basis?)
Allow reversed navigation (shift + TAB)
Allow rediting of a template string (How easy would this be?)
Given a data model create snippets for the structures and give suggestions
	on the user required templates
Given a data model provide tool tip suggestions for the template
